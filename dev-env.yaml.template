# Dev Environment Configuration
# =============================
#
# This file defines which repositories to clone for your development environment.
# Copy this file to `dev-env.yaml` and customize, or use a preset:
#
#   ./setup.sh init <preset>    # Initialize from a preset (e.g., ./setup.sh init tnf)
#   ./setup.sh clone            # Clone all repos defined in dev-env.yaml
#   ./setup.sh status           # Show clone status for all repos
#
# Available presets can be found in the `presets/` directory.
#
# Schema:
#   repos:
#     - name: <repo-name>           # Short name (used as identifier)
#       url: <git-url>              # Full git clone URL
#       directory: <dir-name>       # Directory name under repos/
#       branch: <branch>            # Branch to clone (main, master, tag, etc.)
#       category: <category>        # One of: docs, development, testing, deployment, troubleshooting
#       summary: <one-liner>        # Brief description of the repo's role
#
# All repos are cloned using --filter=blob:none (blobless clone):
#   - Full repo structure visible, all files accessible
#   - Blob contents fetched on-demand when read
#   - Much faster initial clone, smaller disk footprint

repos:
  # Example entry:
  # - name: my-repo
  #   url: https://github.com/org/my-repo.git
  #   directory: my-repo
  #   branch: main
  #   category: development
