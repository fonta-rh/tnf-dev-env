# Resume Project Workspace

You are helping a developer resume work on an existing project workspace.
Projects live under the `projects/` directory. Your job is to reload
context and get the developer back up to speed quickly.

Everything after "resume" in `$ARGUMENTS` is an optional project name
to resume directly.

## Step 1: Select Project

**1a. Determine project name**

If the user provided a name after "resume" in the arguments (e.g.,
`/project:resume OCPBUGS-74679`), use that as the target project name.

If no name was provided (`/project:resume` with no arguments), scan the
`projects/` directory using the Bash tool (`ls projects/`) and present
all directories as options via AskUserQuestion so the user can pick one.

**1b. Validate project exists**

Check that `projects/<name>/` exists. If it does not:
- Show an error: "Project `<name>` not found."
- List all available projects from `projects/`
- Ask the user to pick from the list or provide a corrected name

## Step 2: Load Project Context

Read whatever context file the project has, in priority order:

**2a. Try `projects/<name>/CLAUDE.md`**

If the file exists, read it in full. Then check if it starts with YAML
frontmatter (a line that is exactly `---` followed by YAML content and
closed by another `---`):
- **Has frontmatter**: Parse the YAML to extract `project`, `type`,
  `created`, `status`, `jira`, `repos`, and `related_links` fields.
- **No frontmatter**: Treat the entire file as free-form context. Infer
  the project type from headings or content if possible (e.g., "Bug
  Summary" → bug, "Feature Summary" → feature).

**2b. Fall back to `projects/<name>/README.md`**

If no CLAUDE.md exists but README.md does, read it in full. Infer the
project type from headings or content if possible.

**2c. No context file**

If neither CLAUDE.md nor README.md exists:
- List all files in the project directory (see Step 2d)
- Ask the user: "This project has no CLAUDE.md or README.md. Can you
  briefly describe what this project is about so I can help you
  continue?"

**2d. List project files**

In all cases, list all files in the project directory (recursively) using
the Bash tool (`find projects/<name>/ -type f | sort`). This gives both
you and the user a picture of what's in the project.

**2e. Auto-load repo context**

If the project's frontmatter contains a `repos` list (non-empty), load
context for each repo to prime your understanding of the codebase:

1. For each repo name in the `repos` list:
   a. First, check if `repos/<repo>/CLAUDE.md` exists. If so, read it.
   b. Otherwise, search for `presets/*/context/<repo>.md`. If found,
      read the first match.
   c. If neither exists, skip silently (the repo may not have context
      files yet).
2. After loading, briefly note to the user which repo context files
   were loaded (e.g., "Loaded context for: cluster-etcd-operator,
   installer").
3. Do NOT load context for repos not listed in the project's
   frontmatter — only load what's relevant to this project.

## Step 3: Present Project Summary

Display a structured summary using this format:

```
## 📂 Project: <name>

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | <type from frontmatter, or inferred, or "Unknown"> |
| **Created** | <date from frontmatter, or "Unknown"> |
| **Status** | <status from frontmatter, or "Unknown"> |
| **JIRA** | <URL from frontmatter, or "None"> |
| **Repos** | <comma-separated list, or "None specified"> |

### Files
<list all files found in Step 2d>

### Progress
<If the context file contains checklist items (`- [x]` and `- [ ]`),
show a summary line like: "3/6 items completed" and list the checklist
items. If no checklist items found, say "No progress checklist found.">
```

After the summary table, confirm that the full CLAUDE.md or README.md
content has been read into context (it was read in Step 2 — just note
this to the user so they know the context is loaded).

## Step 4: Suggest Next Steps

Based on the project state, provide actionable suggestions:

**4a. Next checklist item**

If the context file has a Progress section with checklist items, find
the first unchecked item (`- [ ]`) and suggest it as the immediate next
action. For example:
> "Based on your progress checklist, the next step is: **Logs collected
> and analyzed**. Would you like to start on that?"

**4b. Skill suggestions**

Suggest relevant skills based on the project type:

| Type | Skills to suggest |
|------|-------------------|
| bug | `/prow-job:analyze-test-failure`, `/prow-job:analyze-install-failure`, `/prow-job:extract-must-gather`, `/feature-dev:feature-dev` |
| feature | `/feature-dev:feature-dev`, `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` |
| ci-testing | `/prow-job:analyze-test-failure`, `/prow-job:analyze-install-failure`, `/prow-job:analyze-resource`, `/prow-job:extract-must-gather` |
| docs | `/feature-dev:feature-dev` |
| analysis | `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`, `/prow-job:analyze-test-failure`, `/feature-dev:feature-dev` |

If the type is unknown, suggest `/feature-dev:feature-dev` as a general
starting point.

**4c. Ask what to work on**

End by asking the user what they'd like to work on. Use AskUserQuestion
with contextually relevant options based on the project state. Always
include a "Something else" option. For example, for a bug investigation
with unchecked items:
- "Work on next checklist item: <item>"
- "Review/update project notes"
- "Something else"

## Important Notes

- Always use the Write tool to read/create files, never echo/cat via Bash
- Use Bash tool for `ls`, `find`, and `mkdir -p` operations
- If the project has no context file, don't try to fabricate one — ask
  the user for context instead
