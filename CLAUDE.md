# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A **reusable development environment generator** for multi-repo OpenShift development. It provides:
- A preset system for bootstrapping dev environments (`presets/`)
- A setup script for cloning and managing repositories (`setup.sh`)
- Project workspaces for structured task tracking (`projects/`)
- Claude Code skills for common workflows (`.claude/skills/`)

All source repositories are cloned into the `repos/` folder. Use `/dev-env-setup` to initialize from a preset, or create a custom `dev-env.yaml`.

## Source of Truth Priority

**IMPORTANT**: When answering questions or implementing changes:
1. **Always look at repos in this workspace FIRST** before using internal knowledge or web searches
2. If a component has a repo here, that repo is the **authoritative source of truth**
3. Code in `repos/` reflects the latest development state, which may differ from public documentation

## Fork Model

All repositories use a fork model for contributions:
- Push changes to your personal fork first, not directly to upstream
- Create pull requests from your fork to the upstream repository

## Repository Table

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED by /dev-env-setup — do not edit manually -->
<!-- To regenerate, run /dev-env-setup or update dev-env.yaml and re-run the skill -->

| Name | Category | Summary |
|------|----------|---------|

> **No repos configured yet.** Run `/dev-env-setup` to initialize from a preset, or create a custom `dev-env.yaml` from the template.

## Skills

| Skill | Usage | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `/dev-env-setup` | Initialize or refresh dev environment | Set up from preset or custom repos |
| `/project:new` | Create a new project workspace | Structured workspace for a specific task |
| `/project:resume` | Resume an existing project | Reload context and continue work |

## Preset Docs

For architecture details, debugging commands, and domain concepts, see the active preset's docs under `presets/<name>/`:
- `presets/<name>/docs/` — Architecture diagrams, debugging guides, domain concepts
- `presets/<name>/context/<repo>.md` — Per-repo context files (loaded on demand by `/project:resume`)
